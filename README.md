# Rib
Rib is a simple, light-weight Jquery plugin that adds a customizable, dismissable, and cookie-aware ribbon to the bottom of the page.

To Use:
  1. Make sure you're using JQuery on your site 
  2. Add rib.js (or rib.min.js) right before the closing body tag, and after JQuery is loaded.
  3. See rib-example.js for an example initialization of Rib that can be included as part of your sites main JS, or added to a script tag just before the closing body tag
